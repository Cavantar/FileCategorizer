# FileCategorizer
Have you ever downloaded multiple of completely legal video files, and each of the files was in separate directory with lots of other unneeded stuff. You're in luck because FileCategorizer is here for the rescue.

Just supply "fileCategorizerConfig.json" with regex definitions of where each match should go and pass directory throught cmdline and you're done. Files will sort themselves.
